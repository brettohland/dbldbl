Back in 2012/2013, with only a front-end web development background I decided that I wanted to be an iOS developer. This is my first application that I ever released.

The source-code is ridiculously embarrassing. Look in awe at such blunders as:

- Be in awe at my lack of understanding how delegates work and hacking a view transition out of thin air.
- Be angry as the app crashes if you don't have Instagram installed.
- See that the iRate library is included but never actually shown on screen.
- Fill yourself with confusion as you wonder why a scrolling view wasn't used to allow for more than 5 filters.
- Writhe in horror at the lack of tallscreen support even in iOS 6.

Ultimately, as much as I loathe looking at the source this is a concrete example of the beginning of my iOS development career. The app managed to get me my first iOS job and pay for a few years of iOS development.
